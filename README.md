# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It was built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for the front-end, and Node and Express for the back-end.

This was a project built as part of the awesome Web Development bootcamp offered by [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/).
